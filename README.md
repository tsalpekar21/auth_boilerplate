#Authentication Boilerplate

This app uses React, Node (Express) and MongoDB.

The reason it was created was because having boilerplate code to start projects is always solid.

Also, because I had never used any of the technologies I listed above, so it was good practice.

It feautres:
  Token based authentication (using jsonwebtoken)
  Signing in
  Signing out
  Updating a user's profile
  Session expiration

To install: npm install && npm run deploy
